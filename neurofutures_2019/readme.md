# Artifacts generated in preparation for Neurofutures 2019

## File tree

- /: the main GIMP files produced
  - tigue_lightening.xcf: the lightening talk one-slider
- original_cached_images/: stuff cached from the web and used in production of poster and lightening slide
- derived_images/: images from original_cached_images/ which I proceeded to modify and add citations
- published/: artifacts actually submitted to NF19
  - tigue.png: submitted for original deadline
  - tigue_v2.pdf: resubmitted for extended deadline (and realized GIMP exports nicer PDFs than PNGs)
